# Projet-SY5

This is our third year project as computer science student, in wich we did a complete bash working by its own.

## Installation

In order to use our project you juste need to clone this github page.

Therefore all you have to do is :
```bash
git clone https://gaufre.informatique.univ-paris-diderot.fr/tomasi/projet-sy5.git

cd projet-sy5
```

## Usage

Using the Makefile to build the jsh.c file and create an executive file
```bash
make
```

To run the executive file.
```bash

```

If you want to exit the current bash or execution you are doing
```bash
exit [val]
```
